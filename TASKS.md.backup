## Architecture & Design Patterns

### ARCH-001: Refactor monolithic workflow.go into focused packages

**Category:** Architecture  
**Goal Type:** Long-term  
**Complexity:** High  
**Effort:** 5 days  
**Priority:** P0  
**Dependencies:** None

#### Current State
- `workflow.go` contains 463 lines with mixed responsibilities (engine, executors, graph operations)
- All 23 node types implemented in a single file or scattered across multiple files
- No clear package boundaries
- Type definitions mixed with implementation

#### Objective
Separate concerns into distinct packages following Go best practices and SOLID principles.

#### Proposed Package Structure

### ARCH-002: Implement Strategy Pattern for node executors

**Category:** Architecture  
**Goal Type:** Long-term  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Effort:** 3 days  
**Priority:** P0  
**Dependencies:** ARCH-001

#### Current State
- Large switch statement in `executeNode()` with 23 cases
- Hard to add new node types
- Tight coupling between engine and node execution logic

#### Objective
Replace switch statement with Strategy Pattern for extensible, maintainable node execution.

#### Design

```go
// pkg/executor/executor.go
type NodeExecutor interface {
    Execute(ctx context.Context, node types.Node, inputs []interface{}) (interface{}, error)
    NodeType() types.NodeType
    Validate(node types.Node) error
}

type ExecutorRegistry struct {
    executors map[types.NodeType]NodeExecutor
    mu        sync.RWMutex
}

func (r *ExecutorRegistry) Register(exec NodeExecutor) error {
    r.mu.Lock()
    defer r.mu.Unlock()
    
    if _, exists := r.executors[exec.NodeType()]; exists {
        return fmt.Errorf("executor already registered: %s", exec.NodeType())
    }
    
    r.executors[exec.NodeType()] = exec
    return nil
}

func (r *ExecutorRegistry) Execute(ctx context.Context, node types.Node, inputs []interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
    r.mu.RLock()
    exec, exists := r.executors[node.Type]
    r.mu.RUnlock()
    
    if !exists {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("no executor registered for type: %s", node.Type)
    }
    
    return exec.Execute(ctx, node, inputs)
}
```

#### Benefits

- [ ] Error handling consistent across all executors

#### Implementation Steps
1. Define `NodeExecutor` interface
2. Create `ExecutorRegistry` implementation
3. Implement executor for each node type
4. Create registration system
5. Update engine to use registry
6. Write tests for each executor

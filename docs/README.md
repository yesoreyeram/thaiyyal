# Docs: Workflow Builder Brainstorming

This folder contains brainstorming and design notes for an enterprise-grade visual workflow builder focused on observability and analytics workflows (drag-and-drop nodes and connections). The aim is to design a platform similar in scope and polish to n8n, Buildship, or Postman Flows but specialized for observability/analytics use cases.

Files:

- `BRAINSTORMING.md` — Main, detailed brainstorming/requirements/architecture document.
- `NODE_TYPES.md` — Catalogue of node types and behaviors (triggers, actions, transforms, analytics, sinks, control nodes).
- `EXAMPLES.md` — Example workflows (including the timeseries pipeline described by the product example) and small pseudo-specs.

Use these notes as the starting point for scoping a high-fidelity design, implementation plan, and technical architecture for an enterprise product.

Generated: brainstorming docs (no implementation) — aimed at product, architecture, security, and UX teams.

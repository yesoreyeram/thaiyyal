# Brainstorming: Enterprise Workflow Builder (Observability / Analytics)

Overview

- Purpose: Design an enterprise-grade visual workflow builder for observability and analytics workflows. Users compose workflows by dragging nodes (triggers, actions, transforms, analytics, sinks) and connecting them to define data flows and processing pipelines.

- Target: DevOps/Platform/Observability engineers, SREs, data engineers, analytics teams, and internal platform teams building integrations and dashboards.

- Inspiration: n8n, Buildship, Postman Flow — aim to match or exceed reliability, security, and extensibility for enterprise use.

High-level Product Goals

- Expressive: Support complex logic (branching, fan-out, fan-in, loops, stateful processing).

- Robust & reliable: Durable executions, retries, checkpointing, idempotency.

- Secure & compliant: Secret management, least-privilege connectors, audit logs, SSO/SCIM, encryption.

- Scalable: Handle high-volume telemetry, many concurrent workflows and long-running jobs.

- Extensible: Pluggable connectors/nodes, SDK for custom nodes, marketplace.

- Observability-first: Built-in metrics, tracing, structured logs, and run-time debugging tools.

Personas and Use Cases

- SRE / Platform Engineer: Build flows to transform and route metrics/logs/trace-derived events into internal dashboards and alerting systems.

- Data Engineer: Periodic enrichment and rollups of telemetry data to feed analytics stores.

- App Owner: Attach custom transforms and visualizations to instrumentation outputs and embed charts in dashboards.

Enterprise Requirements

- Multi-tenancy & isolation (namespaces, orgs, teams).

- RBAC and fine-grained permissions (create/execute/edit/manage connectors/workflows).

- Audit trails and immutable run logs for compliance.

- Secrets storage and rotation with integration to Vault/KV providers.

- SSO/SAML/OIDC, provisioning via SCIM.

- Data residency and encryption at rest & transit.

Core UX / Interaction Model (Canvas)

- Canvas: Infinite zoom, pan, grid snap, alignment guides, minimap.

- Nodes: Drag from component palette, drop onto canvas, connect via edges.

- Edge semantics: Strongly-typed edges where nodes advertise input/output schemas.

- Property pane: Side panel to configure selected node (credentials, parameters, mapping expressions).

- Inline editor: Code editors for transform nodes (JS/Python/SQL) with linting and autocomplete.

- Test-run / Dry-run: Run a node or subgraph with sample payloads and view step-by-step output.

- Debugging: Step-through executions, set breakpoints, view intermediate payloads, view time-series traces for runs.

- Collaboration: Comments on nodes/edges, version history, branching and workspace isolation.

- Accessibility: Keyboard shortcuts, screen-reader friendly labels, high-contrast UI.

Node Model & Data Shape

- Node contract: Each node defines:

  - Inputs: named ports and expected schema(s).

  - Outputs: named ports and produced schema(s).

  - Config: static parameters, credentials, and runtime options.

  - Execution mode: sync / async / streaming / stateful.

- Data model: Canonical runtime message envelope:

  - { id, trace_id, timestamp, metadata: {workflow, runId, nodeId}, payload }

- Schema propagation: Nodes can declare output schema; system performs lightweight validation and offers mapping helpers.

Execution Semantics

- Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) by default. Support controlled loops via special loop nodes with guard/limits.

- Execution modes:

  - Single-run (trigger -> path executes once)

  - Streaming (continuous flow, backpressure-aware)

  - Batch (accumulate and run periodically)

- Concurrency: Node-level concurrency controls and global worker pool.

- Fan-out/fan-in: Parallel mapping with join/aggregate semantics.

- Idempotency: Provide run IDs and dedup keys for external side-effects.

Persistence & State

- Workflow definitions: versioned JSON/YAML stored in DB (Postgres/Cloud-native store).

- Runs: Durable run records with event-sourced logs for each node step.

- Checkpointing: Save intermediate state for recoverability and long-running jobs.

Error Handling

- Retries and backoff policies (per-node override).

- Dead-letter routing for persistent failures.

- Compensating/rollback patterns: Provide library nodes to undo side effects where possible.

- Granular failure visibility and per-run debugging tools.

Security & Secrets

- Secrets vault integration: Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS/Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault.

- Secrets scoped to org/team/workflow and never exposed in logs (masking by default).

- Connector credentials stored encrypted at rest; rotated by policy.

- Network controls: egress policies for connectors, VPC peering, private endpoints.

Observability & Telemetry

- Built-in metrics: workflow/runs per minute, success/failure rates, node latency distributions.

- Distributed tracing: correlate trace_id across nodes and downstream calls.

- Logs: structured run logs with searchable indices (Elasticsearch / Clickhouse / Loki).

- Runtime dashboard for queued jobs, worker health, and alerts for SLA breaches.

Scalability & Resilience

- Stateless control-plane with horizontally scalable workers for execution.

- Job/queue model: durable queues (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS) for high-throughput workflows.

- Partitioning: shard workflows/runs across worker groups; sticky routing for stateful nodes.

- Autoscaling: metrics-driven scaling of worker fleets.

Extensibility & Developer Experience

- Node SDK: lightweight SDK for building custom nodes (JS/TS, Python). SDK handles inputs/outputs, credentials, and testing harness.

- Marketplace: publish and install community and enterprise nodes.

- CLI & IaC: export/import workflows as code, CI/CD integration for workflow definitions.

Deployment Options

- SaaS: Fully-managed offering, multi-tenant, optional private networking.

- Self-hosted: Helm charts and manifests for Kubernetes; support for on-premise DBs and secrets.

- Hybrid: Control-plane SaaS + customer-managed workers (egress to private networks).

Governance & Enterprise Policies

- Quotas & rate-limits per org/team.

- Policy engine for allowed connectors, script execution rules, node sandboxing.

- Policy-as-code integration for automated checks in CI.

Testing & QA

- Unit-test harness for nodes: mock inputs, assert outputs.

- Integration testing: run workflows against staging endpoints with recorded fixtures.

- Replay: re-run historical runs with same inputs for debugging.

Example (summary): Observability timeseries pipeline

- Trigger: Manual button / periodic schedule / webhook

- Node A: HTTP GET to an API endpoint to fetch metrics

- Node B: Extract relevant fields from response (JSONPath/JQ/Mapper)

- Node C: Transform and aggregate into timeseries buckets (JS/SQL/transform node)

- Node D: Push into timeseries store (Prometheus remote write / Influx / ClickHouse)

- Node E: Chart node (render timeseries chart for UI or export as image)

Open Questions & Trade-offs

- Execution sandbox: run arbitrary JS/Python — use containerized sandboxes or WebAssembly for isolation? Trade-off between speed and safety.

- Streaming vs batch: supporting both increases complexity—start with single-run + scheduled batch, add streaming later.

- Schema enforcement: how strict? Best to provide progressive typing with opt-in enforcement.

Next Steps

1. Align product stakeholders on persona priorities and top integrations.

2. Create a minimal viable node set and a simple execution engine prototype.

3. Build UI mockups for the canvas, property pane, and debug tools.

4. Prototype node SDK and pluggable connector model.

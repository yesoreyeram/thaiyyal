# Issue 1: Distributed Workflow Execution Engine

**Title**: `[EPIC] Distributed Workflow Execution Engine`

**Labels**: `epic`, `enhancement`, `priority:high`, `complexity:very-high`, `area:backend`, `area:infrastructure`

## Overview
Implement distributed workflow execution engine for horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and resource isolation.

## Problem
- **Current**: Single-process execution limits scalability
- **Need**: Distributed execution across workers with auto-failover

## Business Value
- 10x more concurrent executions
- 99.9% uptime with automatic recovery
- Better resource utilization

## Key Components
1. **Coordinator Service** (scheduling, monitoring)
2. **Worker Pool** (auto-scaling, execution)
3. **Task Queue** (Redis/NATS/Kafka)
4. **Distributed State Store**

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design architecture & select technologies
- [ ] Implement coordinator & worker services
- [ ] Add fault tolerance & recovery
- [ ] Add observability (metrics, tracing, dashboards)
- [ ] Tests: unit (>80%), integration, chaos, load
- [ ] Documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements
- P95 latency < 100ms
- Support 10,000+ concurrent executions
- 99.9% uptime, <30s recovery

## Timeline
**Effort**: 20-30 person-days | **Duration**: 10 weeks | **Team**: 2 backend + 1 DevOps engineer

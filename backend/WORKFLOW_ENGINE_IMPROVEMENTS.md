## Technical Implementation Details

### ENGINE-001: Topological Sort Optimization

#### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Ring Buffer Queue**
   - Eliminated O(n) slice operations
   - Changed from `queue = queue[1:]` to index-based access
   
2. **Pre-allocated Data Structures**
   - Exact capacity for all maps/slices
   - Reduced GC pressure
   
3. **Insertion Sort**
   - Optimized for small orphan node sets
   - Better cache locality
   
4. **Index-based Iteration**
   - Reduced memory copying
   - Better compiler optimization

#### Files Modified
- `backend/pkg/graph/graph.go` - Optimized TopologicalSort()

#### Files Created
- `backend/pkg/graph/graph_test.go` - Unit tests (100% coverage)
- `backend/pkg/graph/graph_bench_test.go` - Performance benchmarks

- `backend/pkg/graph/FINAL_SUMMARY.md` - Final results

### PERF-003: HTTP Connection Pooling

#### Implementation Details

1. **Shared HTTP Client**
   - Single client instance per HTTPExecutor
   - Reused across all requests
   
2. **Thread-Safe Initialization**
   - Double-checked locking pattern
   - `sync.RWMutex` for concurrent access
   
3. **Optimized Pool Settings**
   ```go
   MaxIdleConns:          100  (was 10)
   MaxIdleConnsPerHost:   10   (new)
   MaxConnsPerHost:       100  (new)
   IdleConnTimeout:       90s  (was 30s)
   ```

4. **Connection Reuse**
   - Keep-alive enabled
   - Connections persisted between requests

#### Files Modified
- `backend/pkg/executor/http.go` - Connection pooling
- `backend/pkg/engine/engine.go` - Updated registration

#### Files Created

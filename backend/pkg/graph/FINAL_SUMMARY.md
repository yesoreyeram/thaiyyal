## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Ring buffer approach was the biggest performance win
2. Pre-allocation significantly reduced GC pressure
3. Comprehensive benchmarking revealed optimization opportunities
4. Test-driven approach caught edge cases early

### Optimization Insights
1. For small slices (<20 elements), insertion sort outperforms quicksort
2. Ring buffers eliminate expensive slice reallocation
3. Pre-allocating with exact capacity matters more than expected
4. Index-based iteration is faster than range iteration for large slices

## 🔜 Next Steps (from TASKS.md)

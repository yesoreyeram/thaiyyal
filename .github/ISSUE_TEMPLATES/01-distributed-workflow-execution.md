## Overview

Implement a distributed workflow execution engine that enables horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and resource isolation across multiple worker nodes.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: Workflows execute in a single process with in-memory state, limiting scalability and fault tolerance.

**Desired State**: Distributed execution across multiple workers with:
- Horizontal scaling for high-load scenarios
- Fault tolerance for long-running workflows
- Resource isolation between workflows
- Automatic failover and recovery

## Business Value

- **Scalability**: Handle 10x more concurrent workflow executions
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic recovery
- **Performance**: Reduce execution time through parallel processing
- **Cost**: Better resource utilization and cost efficiency

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Components

1. **Coordinator Service**
   - Workflow scheduling and routing
   - Worker health monitoring
   - Task distribution
   - Execution state tracking

2. **Worker Pool**
   - Dynamic scaling (auto-scale based on load)
   - Health checks and heartbeats
   - Task execution
   - Result reporting

3. **Task Queue**
   - Reliable message delivery
   - Priority queues
   - Dead letter queues
   - Monitoring and observability

4. **Distributed State Store**
   - Workflow execution state
   - Node output caching
   - Coordination metadata
   - Consistency guarantees

### Technology Stack Options

**Task Queue**:
- Option A: Redis Streams (lower complexity, good for MVP)
- Option B: RabbitMQ (mature, feature-rich)
- Option C: NATS JetStream (cloud-native, high performance)
- Option D: Apache Kafka (enterprise-grade, high throughput)

**State Store**:
- Option A: Redis (fast, simple)
- Option B: etcd (strong consistency, coordination)
- Option C: PostgreSQL (familiar, ACID guarantees)

**Coordination**:
- Option A: Leader election via etcd
- Option B: Raft consensus
- Option C: Database-backed coordination

### State Management

```go
type ExecutionState struct {
    WorkflowID    string
    ExecutionID   string
    Status        ExecutionStatus
    NodeStates    map[string]NodeState
    StartTime     time.Time
    EndTime       *time.Time
    Error         *string
    Metadata      map[string]interface{}
}

type NodeState struct {
    NodeID       string
    Status       NodeStatus
    Input        interface{}
    Output       interface{}
    Error        *string
    Attempts     int
    LastAttempt  time.Time
}
```

### Task Queue Message Format

```json
{
  "task_id": "uuid",
  "workflow_id": "uuid",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "node_id": "node_1",
  "node_type": "http",
  "node_config": {...},
  "input_data": {...},
  "priority": 5,
  "timeout": 30,
  "retry_policy": {
    "max_attempts": 3,
    "backoff": "exponential"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "tenant_id": "tenant_1",
    "user_id": "user_1"
  }

## How to Create These Issues

Since GitHub CLI (`gh`) requires authentication that I cannot provide, you have two options:

### Option 1: Manual Creation (Recommended for review)
1. Go to https://github.com/yesoreyeram/thaiyyal/issues/new
2. Copy the title, labels, and body from each issue below
3. Create the issue

### Option 2: Automated Creation (Fast)
1. Ensure you have GitHub CLI installed: `gh --version`
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Run: `bash scripts/create-all-github-issues.sh`

# Issue 1: Distributed Workflow Execution Engine

**Title**: `[EPIC] Distributed Workflow Execution Engine`

**Labels**: `epic`, `enhancement`, `priority:high`, `complexity:very-high`, `area:backend`, `area:infrastructure`

**Body**:

```markdown
## Overview

Implement a distributed workflow execution engine that enables horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and resource isolation across multiple worker nodes.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: Workflows execute in a single process with in-memory state, limiting scalability and fault tolerance.

**Desired State**: Distributed execution across multiple workers with:
- Horizontal scaling for high-load scenarios
- Fault tolerance for long-running workflows
- Resource isolation between workflows
- Automatic failover and recovery

## Business Value

- **Scalability**: Handle 10x more concurrent workflow executions
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic recovery
- **Performance**: Reduce execution time through parallel processing
- **Cost**: Better resource utilization and cost efficiency

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Components

1. **Coordinator Service**
   - Workflow scheduling and routing
   - Worker health monitoring
   - Task distribution
   - Execution state tracking

2. **Worker Pool**
   - Dynamic scaling (auto-scale based on load)
   - Health checks and heartbeats
   - Task execution
   - Result reporting

3. **Task Queue**
   - Reliable message delivery (Redis Streams/RabbitMQ/NATS/Kafka)
   - Priority queues
   - Dead letter queues
   - Monitoring and observability

4. **Distributed State Store**
   - Workflow execution state (Redis/etcd/PostgreSQL)
   - Node output caching
   - Coordination metadata
   - Consistency guarantees

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 1-2)
- [ ] Design distributed architecture document
- [ ] Select task queue technology (with justification)
- [ ] Select state store technology (with justification)
- [ ] Create ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
- [ ] Define communication protocols
- [ ] Design failure scenarios and recovery strategies
- [ ] Create system diagrams (sequence, component, deployment)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Sprint 3-5)
- [ ] Implement coordinator service (task routing, worker discovery, load balancing)
- [ ] Implement worker service (task consumption, execution, result publishing)
- [ ] Implement task queue integration
- [ ] Implement distributed state management

### Phase 3: Fault Tolerance (Sprint 6-7)
- [ ] Implement failure detection (worker heartbeats, task timeouts)
- [ ] Implement recovery mechanisms (retry, failover, state recovery)
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers
- [ ] Add backpressure mechanisms

### Phase 4: Observability (Sprint 8)
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging with distributed tracing
- [ ] Add metrics (queue depth, worker utilization, latency, errors)
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up alerting rules

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Sprint 9-10)
- [ ] Write unit tests (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests (worker failures, network partitions)
- [ ] Load testing (baseline, scalability, breaking point)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Complete documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: P95 latency < 100ms for task routing, support 10,000+ concurrent executions
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, zero data loss, automatic recovery < 30 seconds
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling to 100+ workers, auto-scaling based on queue depth
- **Security**: mTLS between components, task payload encryption, audit logging

## Timeline

**Estimated Effort**: 20-30 person-days  
**Recommended Team**: 2 backend engineers + 1 DevOps engineer  
**Duration**: 10 weeks
